# Contributing

Floem aims to be a high performance UI library. New contributions are always welcome!

To start with, the best way to learn how Floem works is probably to look at the examples. And if you think there are more examples that can be added, feel free to send a PR in.

Alternatively, you can have a look at issues, to see if there's anything you'd like to pick up. 

Firing bugs with clear reproducing steps is a really good way of contributing as well.

It's not a good library if there isn't good documentation. So any documentation contributions will be much appreciated. 

If you'd like a conversation with Floem devs, you can join in the #floem channel on this [Discord](https://discord.gg/RB6cRYerXX).
